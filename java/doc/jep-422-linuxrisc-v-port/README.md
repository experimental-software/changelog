# JEP 422: Linux/RISC-V Port

RISC-V is an open source instruction set architecture (ISA) that will most likely become the third mainstream computer architecture amongst x86_64 and ARM.

Since there are plenty of companies building CPUs based on this architecture, it will eventually be used for all kinds of computers:

- Microcontrollers
- Embedded devices
- System on a chip
- Servers
- Laptops
- mobile phones
- ...

So, with this change, Java usage will be enabled for this new kind of computer architecture.
